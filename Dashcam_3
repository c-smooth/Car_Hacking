It is possible to use TF_Lite on a video feed, but battery life is terrible unless a powerbank is used. Tf_Lite is an interesting use case for small datatsets for common objects such as on roadways or construction sites. 
At 30 percent mAp you will find success. You must use Autofocus cameras to find success at 30 mAp. Keras is the easiest to debug, but you are welcomed to use OpenCV. I would like it to be used for driver's ed.
